# AirNode Alliance

## About

The AirNode Alliance (ANA), developed by ELOC Mobile Solutions, aims to democratize access to telecommunications infrastructure by enabling fractional ownership of AirNodes through NFTs. This initiative leverages blockchain technology (World Mobile Chain - WMC) to create a decentralized ecosystem where individuals can own and earn from telecom infrastructure while participating in governance decisions.

## Key Features

- **Fractionalized AirNode Ownership (NFTs)** – AirNodes are divided into fractional shares via NFTs, allowing affordable participation and reward generation.
- **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** – Governance is managed by NFT holders, who vote on proposals like reward distribution, new AirNode purchases and treasury management.
- **Decentralized Application (Dapp)** – A platform for managing NFTs, tracking rewards, voting in governance and withdrawing earnings via smart contracts.
- **ANA Token** – Used for governance, staking, liquidity incentives and marketplace transactions within the ecosystem.
